            New tools enable new ways of working, and materials science is no exception. In materials discovery, traditional manual, serial, and human-intensive work is being augmented by automated, parallel, and iterative processes driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), simulation and experimental automation. In this perspective, we describe how these new capabilities enable the acceleration and enrichment of each stage of the discovery cycle. We show, using the example of the development of a novel chemically amplified photoresist, how these technologies{\textquoteright} impacts are amplified when they are used in concert with each other as powerful, heterogeneous workflows.},

            Atomic-scale phase transformations profoundly influence the functional properties of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ polymorphs. By combining irradiation experiments with microstructure characterization and theoretical approaches, phase-specific energy-dissipation pathways in $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\varepsilon$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ are uncovered and strategies for targeted property design are outlined. Competing antiphase boundaries (APBs) and twin domain boundaries (TDBs) promote irreversible $\alpha${\textrightarrow}$\varepsilon$ interconversion through domain fragmentation. In $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$, defect-induced stress gradients drive two distinct local transformations: surface Ga-aggregated $\beta${\textrightarrow}$\delta$ that stabilizes transient states, and latent-track-confined $\beta${\textrightarrow}$\kappa$ phase transition with recoverable distortions via cation reordering. Under electronic excitation, $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ forms nanohillocks via robust GaO$_{6}$ octahedra (high density/strong Ga-O bonds), while $\alpha$/$\varepsilon$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ generates nanopores from tetrahedral Ga looseness (low bonding energy), highlighting phase-dependent surface dynamics shaped by atomic packing and bonding anisotropy. Defect-regulated recombination suppresses visible photoluminescence in $\alpha$/$\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$, whereas in $\varepsilon$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ bandgap narrowing of $\Delta$E: 0.30~eV is observed, enhancing emission. Linking phase-dependent defect-carrier interactions and metastable-phase engineering in Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ enables property optimization for power-electronics and optoelectronics devices.},

Monatomic hydrogen has low formation energies and acts as a shallow donor in both interstitial and substitutional configurations. We also explore other dopants, where substitutional forms of Si, Ge, Sn, F, and Cl are shown to behave as shallow donors.},

Restricted Hartree{\textendash}Fock calculations, with large-core Ga and O pseudopotentials, are done to optimize the structure of first the bulk and then of slabs {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}cut{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} in the required orientations. The slab unit cells are fully relaxed during optimization, and the displacements of all atoms from the ideally-terminated positions are obtained as functions of depth into the bulk. For the relaxed slabs, single-point density functional theory calculations using the B3LYP functional and all-electron basis sets are performed to obtain surface energies, ionic charges and bond overlap populations. All surfaces exhibit a decrease in surface energy upon relaxation, and the local bonding at the surface is analyzed by comparing nearest-neighbor bond lengths and overlap populations with those in the bulk. The {\dh}1 0 1{\TH} surface, which exhibits a high energy when ideally terminated, undergoes large displacements and changes in bonding during relaxation leading to a substantial lowering of the surface energy. The band structure is also obtained for the lowest-energy surface, which is one of the possible non-polar terminations of the (1 0 0).

We find that the low-frequency optical phonon modes make a significant contribution to the thermal conductivity compared to the acoustic modes, especially in the [010] direction because of the non-negligible group velocities of the low-frequency optical branches. To better understand the influence of defects on the phonon transport mechanism, we investigate the thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Ga

              Radiation tolerance is determined as the ability of crystalline materials to withstand the accumulation of the radiation induced disorder. Nevertheless, for sufficiently high fluences, in all by far known semiconductors it ends up with either very high disorder levels or amorphization. Here we show that gamma/beta ($\gamma$/$\beta$) double polymorph Ga

              structures exhibit remarkably~high radiation tolerance. Specifically, for room temperature experiments, they tolerate a disorder equivalent to hundreds of displacements per atom, without severe degradations of crystallinity; in comparison with, e.g., Si amorphizable already with the lattice atoms displaced just once. We explain this behavior by an interesting combination of the Ga- and O- sublattice properties in $\gamma$-Ga

Such tracks readily form in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that, in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments.},

The epitaxial growth technique of $\beta$-Ga2O3 thin films plays a fundamental and vital role in Ga2O3-based device fabrication. In this work, the epitaxial growth mechanisms of $\beta$-Ga2O3 on four low-Miller-index facets, (100), (010), (001), and (2{\textasciimacron}01), are systematically explored using large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic scale. The simulations reveal that the migration of the face-centered cubic stacking O sublattice plays a dominant role in the different growth mechanisms between the (100)/(010)/(001) and (2{\textasciimacron}01) orientations. The resultant complex combinations of the stacking faults and twin boundaries are carefully identified and show good agreement with experimental observations and ab initio calculations. Our results provide useful insights into the gas-phase epitaxial growth of $\beta$-Ga2O3 thin films and suggest possible ways to tailor its properties for specific applications.},

In this work, the step-flow growth mechanism of the $\beta$-Ga2O3 (100) facet is explored by machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that Ga adatoms and Ga-O adatom pairs, with their high mobility, are the primary atomic species responsible for efficient surface migration on the (100) facet. The asymmetric monoclinic structure of $\beta$-Ga2O3 induces a distinct two-stage Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier for Ga adatoms at the [00-1] step edge, contributing to the suppression of double-step and hillock formation. Furthermore, a miscut toward [00-1] does not induce the nucleation of stable twin boundaries, whereas a miscut toward [001] leads to the spontaneous formation of twin boundaries. This research provides meaningful insights not only for high-quality $\beta$-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy but also the step-flow growth mechanism of other similar systems.},

In this study, we investigate the orientation-dependent mechanisms of primary radiation damage on four experimentally relevant $\beta$-Ga2O3 surface orientations, (100), (010), (001), and (201). We employ atomistic computational modeling approaches integrating machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with density functional theory calculations. Initial cascade simulations reveal that Ga vacancies and O interstitials are the predominant defects across all four surfaces, accompanied by abundant GaO and sparse OGa antisite defects. Notably, the (010) surface exhibits the lowest defect density, owing to its pronounced channeling effect, which results in a spatially dispersed damage distribution. This leads to a distinctive defect evolution behavior for the (010) surface, compared with the three non-channeling surfaces. These atomic-level insights are crucial for assessing the irradiation tolerance and predicting the performance changes of $\beta$-Ga2O3-based devices in irradiated environments.},

The present work reports on the single-step ionbeam-assisted fabrication of multilayered polymorph structures while applying the disorder-induced ordering approach. The dynamic annealing of disorder may be tuned, during ion irradiation, toward self-assembling of several polymorph interfaces. Gallium oxide multilayers with two polymorph interface repetitions are obtained.

In this work, we develop machine-learned neuroevolution potentials (NEPs) for single-crystalline $\beta$-Ga2O3 and $\kappa$-Ga2O3 and demonstrate their accuracy in modeling thermal transport properties. Combining NEP-driven homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with tensor analysis, we determine the spatial distributions of LTCs for two Ga2O3 crystals, showing dissimilar thermal behaviors. Specifically, $\beta$-Ga2O3 shows isotropic thermal transport properties, with the LTCs along [100], [010], and [001] directions being predicted to be 10:3 + 0:2, 19:9 + 0:2, and 12:6 + 0:2 W/(m K), respectively, consistent with previous experimental measurements. For $\kappa$-Ga2O3, our predictions suggest nearly isotropic thermal transport properties, with the LTCs along [100], [010], and [001] being estimated to be 4:5 + 0:1, 3:9 + 0:1, and 4:0 + 0:1 W/(m K). The reduced LTC of $\kappa$-Ga2O3 vs $\beta$-Ga2O3 stems from its restricted low-frequency phonons up to 5 THz. Furthermore, we find that the $\beta$ phase exhibits a typical temperature dependence slightly stronger than T 1, whereas the $\kappa$ phase shows a weaker temperature dependence, ranging from T 0:5 to T 0:7.},

            Thermal transport properties of amorphous materials are crucial for their emerging applications in energy and electronic devices. However, understanding and controlling thermal transport in disordered materials remains an outstanding challenge, owing to the intrinsic limitations of computational techniques and the lack of physically intuitive descriptors for complex atomistic structures. Here, it is shown how combining machine-learning-based models and experimental observations can help to accurately describe realistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure{\textendash}property maps for disordered materials, which is illustrated by a practical application on gallium oxide. First, the experimental evidence is reported to demonstrate that machine-learning interatomic potentials, generated in a self-guided fashion with minimum quantum-mechanical computations, enable the accurate modeling of amorphous gallium oxide and its thermal transport properties. The atomistic simulations then reveal the microscopic changes in the short-range and medium-range order with density and elucidate how these changes can reduce localization modes and enhance coherences{\textquoteright} contribution to heat transport. Finally, a physics-inspired structural descriptor for disordered phases is proposed, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form. This work may shed light on the future accelerated exploration of thermal transport properties and mechanisms in disordered functional materials.},

In this work, an interatomic potential is developed for $\beta$-Ga2O3 based on a deep neural network model to predict the thermal conductivity and phonon transport properties. Our potential is trained by the ab initio energy surface and atomic forces, which reproduces phonon dispersion in good agreement with first-principles calculations. We are able to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the anisotropic thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Ga2O3 with this potential, and the calculated thermal conductivity values agree well with experimental results from 200 to 500 K. Green{\textendash}Kubo modal analysis is performed to quantify the contributions of different phonon modes to the thermal transport, showing that optical phonon modes play a critical role in the thermal transport. This work provides a high-fidelity machine learning-based potential for MD simulation of $\beta$-Ga2O3 and serves as a good example of exploring thermal transport physics of complex semiconductor materials.},

	abstract = {The thermal properties of $\beta$-Ga2O3 can significantly affect the performance and reliability of high-power electronic devices. To date, due to the absence of a reliable interatomic potential, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been routinely used to probe the thermal properties of $\beta$-Ga2O3. DFT calculations can only tackle small-scale systems due to the huge computational cost, while the thermal transport processes are usually associated with large time and length scales. In this work, we develop a machine learning based Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for accurately describing the lattice dynamics of perfect crystalline $\beta$-Ga2O3 and accelerating atomic-scale simulations. The GAP model shows excellent convergence, which can faithfully reproduce the DFT potential energy surface at a training data size of 32 000 local atomic environments. The GAP model is then used to predict ground-state lattice parameters, coefficients of thermal expansion, heat capacity, phonon dispersions at 0 K, and anisotropic thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Ga2O3, which are all in excellent agreement with either the DFT results or experiments. The accurate predictions of phonon dispersions and thermal conductivities demonstrate that the GAP model can well describe the harmonic and anharmonic interactions of phonons. Additionally, the successful application of our GAP model to the phonon density of states of a 2500-atom $\beta$-Ga2O3 structure at elevated temperature indicates the strength of machine learning potentials to tackle large-scale atomic systems in long molecular simulations, which would be almost impossible to generate with DFT-based molecular simulations at present.},

	abstract = {Ga2O3 is an ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor with a variety of crystal configurations, which has the potential for a variety of applications, especially in power electronics and ultraviolet optoelectronics. However, there has been no single interatomic potential reported for Ga2O3 polymorphs in terms of molecular dynamics prediction of thermal conductivity. Here, one interatomic potential has been developed based on neural networks, which has the clear advantages of consuming less computational power than density functional theory and has high accuracy in predicting the thermal conductivity of the three polymorphs of Ga2O3. Using the neuroevolution potential, the thermal conductivity values at 300 K have been predicted. Hence, the j[average-a] was 67.2\% that of b-Ga2O3, and the j[average-e] was only 26.4\% that of b-Ga2O3. The possible reasons for the discrepancies in thermal conductivity values in various crystal types and orientations have been explored. As a result, it could be shown that the contribution of low-frequency phonons to thermal conductivity was very significant in Ga2O3, and a unit cell with low symmetry and high atomic number would negatively impact the thermal conductivity of the material. In this work, a scheme has been proposed for accurately predicting the thermal conductivity of Ga2O3 and a relatively accurate value of the thermal conductivity of e-Ga2O3 has been achieved, which could also provide an atomic-scale perspective for the insight into the thermal conductivity differences among a, b, and e-Ga2O3.},

We increase the accuracy of NEP models both by improving the radial functions in the atomic-environment descriptor using a linear combination of Chebyshev basis functions and by extending the angular descriptor with some four-body and five-body contributions as in the atomic cluster expansion approach. We also detail our efficient implementation of the NEP approach in graphics processing units as well as our workflow for the construction of NEP models and demonstrate their application in large-scale atomistic simulations. By comparing to state-of-the-art MLPs, we show that the NEP approach not only achieves above-average accuracy but also is far more computationally efficient. These results demonstrate that the gpumd package is a promising tool for solving challenging problems requiring highly accurate, large-scale atomistic simulations. To enable the construction of MLPs using a minimal training set, we propose an active-learning scheme based on the latent space of a pre-trained NEP model. Finally, we introduce three separate Python packages, viz., gpyumd, calorine, and pynep, that enable the integration of gpumd into Python workflows.},
